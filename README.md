# Neural_style_transfer_for_Images

This repository describes the Neural_style_transfer algorithm through which we can transfer the style from an image to a different content image

The solution uses Python 2.7, but can also be used with python 3.x

Python packages Required to run the Notebooks: 
* Numpy
* Keras
* Tensorflow
* Scipy

## Steps

* place your own content and style image path in the 2nd cell in the Neural_style_transfer.ipynb notebook
* In the 3rd cell insert a value for n_rows, which will determine the final image breadth.
* Run all the cells to find generate the final images. N.b.: Images are saved per 10 iterations.
